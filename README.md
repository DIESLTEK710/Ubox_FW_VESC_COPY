This is the compliled firmware of the Ubox family, version 5.02 and 5.03, and 6.0.

Ubox is officially supported in the VESC tool 6.0 now.

But we are sorry that the hardware name in the firmware are re-arranged, so the 6.0 VESC tool cann't match them automatically. So please download the right file for your hardware then upgrade them manually by "custom file" mode. Than you.
