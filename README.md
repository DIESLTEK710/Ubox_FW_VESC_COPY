Update FW version 6.02

Added the new UBOX_SINGLE_85_200 firmware for our new Ubox ALU 85V 200A controller.

And raise the hardwarw limit of the input voltage of the Ubox ALU 80V 100A to 85V, in order to make convenience for the users who want run it with 20S battery, its default limit is 78V now.


----------
This is the compliled firmware of the Ubox family, version 5.02 and 5.03, and 6.0.

Ubox is officially supported in the VESC tool 6.0 now.

But we are sorry that the hardware name in the firmware are re-arranged, so the 6.0 VESC tool cann't match them automatically. So please download the right file for your hardware then upgrade them manually by "custom file" mode. After this, the newer firmware will recognize and upgrade by VESC tool  automatically.

Than you.
