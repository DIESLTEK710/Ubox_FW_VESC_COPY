We are sorry that the hardware name in the firmware are re-arranged, so the 6.0 VESC tool cann't match them automatically. So please download the right file for your hardware then upgrade them manually by "custom file" mode. After this, the newer firmware will recognize and upgrade automatically.

The number in the firmware name is voltage, for example UBOX_V2_100 if for ubox V2 100V. For ubox V1, please check your hardware's USB connector, there are two type of them: micro USB and type-C, to choose the firmware with the right USB name for you. 

Becareful to not choose the wrong firmware. After upgrade, check the firmware name displayed in VESC tool first, then connect the motor to do further test.

Thank you.
