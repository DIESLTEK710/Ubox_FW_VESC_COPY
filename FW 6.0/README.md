we are sorry that the hardware name in the firmware are re-arranged, so the 6.0 VESC tool cann't match them automatically. So please download the right file for your hardware then upgrade them manually by "custom file" mode. After this, the newer firmware will recognize and upgrade automatically.

For ubox V1, please check your hardware's USB connector, there is two type of them: mini USB and type-C, to choose the firmware with the right USB name for you.

Thank you.
